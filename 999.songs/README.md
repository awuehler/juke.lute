## An exercise of "play by ear" organization

I picked the jukebox metaphor as an appropriate model to point out how these tunes are arranged into very simple (hopefully, self-organizing) buckets (i.e. folders).

  - There is NO attempt to put each *.abc music file into a strict and/or a hierarchial anthology

Also note, my music sessions are a little bit like jazz improvisation given spontaneous invention of melodic solo sequences in a private performance of music. Mostly unscripted and always a reflection of the location, mood, and feedback. Thus, these ABC files are arranged in like-minded fashion because of ongoing free floating jams.

## Download the "jukebox"

The available ZIP file contains a variety of example *.abc files.

  - A small number, like two dozen or so duplicate ABC files, are copied on purpose into multiple folders because their melodies have more than one impression

A basic exercise for the reader is to download, unpack, and move the juke.lute melody collection into the Music folder used by the LOTRO game.

    PS C:\Users\**********\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\Music> dir
    
        Directory: C:\Users\**********\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\Music
    
    Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
    ----                 -------------         ------ ----
    d----           2/29/2024  5:55 AM                juke.lute

Next, this tutorial does assume that the original Songbook MOD is installed inside LOTRO and so the reader must (re)run the "songbook.hta" tool to (re)build its index across all available *.abc files contained within the LOTRO Music folder after each and every download of a new up-to-date copy of the ZIP file.

  - However, the exact steps are left to the reader as an exercise to find appropriate instruction and/or necessary information to populate the LOTRO Songbook MOD with the juke.lute example tunes

## NO in-game command-line support (Fuhgeddaboudit)

These music files are assigned long file names, with mixed case, punctuation, and artist labels. So sorry, but the reader will find it almost impossible (in practice) to play these ABC files within LOTRO like so:

    Enter Music Mode, type:
    /music <ENTER_KEY>
    Play ABC File, type:
    /play filename <ENTER_KEY>

Seriously, as a practising lute soloist player I do not intend to burn extra time and effort outside the game in search of specific melodies by way of vague or non-intuitive filename references. After repeatedly looking through hundreds and hundreds of short, terse, or obscure *.abc filenames over and over... A decision was reached to reset each and every *.abc filename back to its human understandable format for easier usage inside the LOTRO game (via a MOD).

  - There are no abbreviations used for the sake of preserving the in-game shortcut to allow blind type through to a short *.abc filename
  - Thus required is the use of an in-game extension aka MOD (of which, there are two MODs available to LOTRO)
    - The old/original Songbook MOD is assumed for these exercises
  - Where the Composer/Artist/Venue prefix is first and foremost
    - _Again, apologies in advance for going **too far** in the other direction by using very long filenames_

## Folders and Names and Adjustments

For example, the 'long6' folder contains a selection of melodies that run +6 minutes long:

    Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
    ----                 -------------         ------ ----

    -a---           2/29/2024  5:55 AM          93731 J_Brahms-Cello_Sonata(lute).abc
    -a---           2/29/2024  5:55 AM          58086 Jethro_Tull-Aqualung(lute).abc
    -a---           2/29/2024  5:55 AM          75430 Kondo_Koji-Zelda(lute).abc
    -a---           2/29/2024  5:55 AM          63187 Led_Zeppelin-Stairway_To_Heaven(lute).abc
    -a---           2/29/2024  5:55 AM          11279 Metallica-Nothing_Else_Matters(lute).abc
    -a---           2/29/2024  5:55 AM          29479 Queensrÿche-Silent_Lucidity(lute).abc
    -a---           2/29/2024  5:55 AM          51016 Rachmaninoff-Vocalise(lute).abc
    -a---           2/29/2024  5:55 AM          17433 Rolling_Stones-Wild_Horses(lute).abc

Where, the general naming convention is defined as:

    <Artist_Name> - <Song_Name> (Instrument) . abc

Naturally, **most** music can be traced back to a known/original composer. However, many popular melodies have several artist renditions (different music scores) or may be associated to a movie, show, game, or other type of venue.

  - which makes the selected <Artist_Name> prefix a subjective judgement

When there are multiple choices available for **<Artist_Name>** prefix, then most likely the final label is taken from a physical MIDI source file (when used and/or if known). And here is an example that is clearly not intuitive (many folks will assume it always is the band Van Halen):

    Mavericks-Dance_The_Night_Away(lute).abc

Be aware that a tune can be prefixed as "Traditional" (instead of <Artist_Name>) when the historical composer(s) are unknown and/or search engine results are lacking which are needed to help pin-point any authoritative references in question.

  - Yes, of course "Traditional" could be further segmented into "Irish", "Folk", "Bluegrass", "Classical", & etc.
    - This (re)naming is an exercise left to the reader to (re)organize the *.abc files accordingly
