## An exercise of "play by ear" organization

I picked the jukebox metaphor as an appropriate model to point out how these tunes are arranged into very simple (hopefully, self-organizing) buckets (i.e. folders).

  - There is NO attempt to put each *.abc music file into a strict and/or a hierarchial anthology

Also note, my music sessions are a little bit like jazz improvisation given spontaneous invention of melodic solo sequences in a private performance of music. Mostly unscripted and always a reflection of the location, mood, and player feedback. Thus, these ABC files are arranged in like-minded fashion because of ongoing free floating jams.

## Download the "jukebox"

The available ZIP files will contain a variety of *.abc files that are tuned for specific instruments.

  - A small number duplicate ABC files exists within (and between) each jukebox, and are copied on purpose into multiple folders because their melodies have more than one impression

A basic exercise for the reader is to download updated versions of each jukebox, (re)move the previous folder, unpack the new zip file into a new (empty) jukebox folder located beneath the Music folder used by LOTRO.

    PS C:\Users\**********\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\Music> dir
    
        Directory: C:\Users\**********\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\Music
    
    Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
    ----                 -------------         ------ ----
    d----           2/29/2024  5:55 AM                juke.lute

Next, this tutorial does assume that the original Songbook MOD is installed and LOTRO is configured to use it. The reader must (re)run the "songbook.hta" tool to (re)build the file index for all available *.abc files contained within the LOTRO Music folder after each and every download of a new up-to-date copy of the jukebox ZIP files.

  - However, the exact steps are left to the reader as an exercise to find appropriate instruction and/or necessary information to populate the LOTRO Songbook MOD with any new ABC tunes

## NO in-game command-line support (Fuhgeddaboudit)

These jukebox ABC files are assigned long file names, with mixed case, punctuation, and artist labels. So sorry, but the reader will find it almost impossible (in practice) to play these ABC files within LOTRO like so:

    Enter Music Mode, type:
    /music <ENTER_KEY>
    Play ABC File, type:
    /play filename <ENTER_KEY>
    ...

Seriously, as a practising soloist player I do not intend to burn extra time and effort outside the game in search of specific melodies by way of vague or non-intuitive filename references (optimized for band aka sync playback). After repeatedly looking through hundreds and hundreds of short, terse, or obscure *.abc filenames over and over... A decision was reached to reset each and every solo *.abc filename back to its human understandable format for easier usage inside LOTRO via a MOD.

  - There are no abbreviations used for the sake of preserving the in-game shortcut to allow blind type through to a short *.abc filename

  - Thus required is the use of an in-game extension aka MOD (of which, there are two MODs available to LOTRO)
    - Please note that the old/original Songbook MOD is assumed

  - Where human readable <Tradition> / <Composer> / <Artist> / <Venue> / <Title> labels are first and foremost
    - _Again, apologies in advance for going **too far** in the other direction by using very long filenames_

## Folders and Names and Adjustments

For reference, the 'long6' folder (..\Music\juke.lute\long6) contains a selection of melodies that run +6 minutes long:

Where, the general naming convention is defined as:

    <Artist_Name> - <Song_Name> (Instrument) . abc

Naturally, **most** music can be traced back to a known/original composer. However, many popular melodies have several artist renditions (different music scores) or also associated to movie, show, game, or other type of venues.

  - which makes the selected <Artist_Name> prefix a subjective judgement

When there are multiple choices available for **<Artist_Name>** prefix, then most likely the final label is taken from a physical MIDI source file (when used and/or if known). And here is an example that is clearly not intuitive (many folks will assume it always is the band Van Halen):

    Mavericks-Dance_The_Night_Away(lute).abc

Be aware that many a tune may be prefixed as "Traditional" (instead of <Artist_Name>) when the historical composer(s) are either unknown and/or search engine results are lacking any directions which help to pin-point an authoritative source of reference.

  - Yes, of course "Traditional" could be further segmented into other tags such as "Vintage", "Folk", "Bluegrass", "Medley", & etc.
    - This (re)naming is an exercise left to the reader to (re)organize the *.abc files accordingly
