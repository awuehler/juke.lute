## General Expectations

  - Each new ZIP file uploaded to this project will contain new tunes at a minimum

  - These *.abc files will be renamed, copied, or moved at will

  - Individual *.abc files may be edited and changed without notice to improve tune playback

  - Always remove OR rename the previous juke folders before unzipping a new version of each juke.<instrument> ZIP file
