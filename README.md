# juke.lute

Is an exercise on the playing of tunes within LOTRO specific for the lute instruments. Intended for private use only.

No financial nor material gains of any form has occurred past or present from any ABC files.

Each ABC file is edited using the notational format v2.11 and are adjusted only for in-game LOTRO play.

## Caveat Emptor

Use of these files, including all subsequent information, applications, scripts, products, and services is solely at the user's own risk.

This place is for the solo instrument player, namely for those of us that need to review proper examples to improve ("tune" not "compose") the lute instrument sound.

All ABC files contained herein are named and organized in such a manner which is unlike any other collection of shared *.abc music files used within LOTRO.

## About

I have lurked about the LOTRO MMORPG game since its beginning. My play started within their initial public beta (first 300 to 600 players, I think)... launched (oh so) many years ago.

  - Have seen many mighty realms come and go
  - Said farewell to hundreds of characters passing into the West
  - Weathered every transition, from subscription to free play (including the end-game player of today)
  - Witnessed the doubling of the character cap and the birth of all the regions beyond Eriador
  - Long ago wrote some 3rd party software and used some hardware hackery for the game
  - "Over hill and under tree"... so on and so forth

**Today/Tomorrow**: Casual solo roll-play. Where, every year or so I step back into this wonderful community to pick-up where I left off and perhaps do a little more that is new to me and new for LOTRO

    Please allow me to introduce myself
    I'm a man of wealth and taste
    I've been around for a long, long year
    ...

A most appropriate tune quote.
